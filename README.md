### Still need to change
 * Theme
 > Theme to be uniform accross all pages. including buttons, links, pages, etc.

 > Home page is using a placeholder image, change when we come to an agreement.

 > Ensure the home page design does not distort on different devices.

 > Any other advice for design can be incorporated once agreed upon.

 * Pricing
 > Take all prices out, change database to accept the animals name instead of taking a decimal for price.

 > No pricing should be seen at all as there is no pricing for our NGO rather they will accept a booking.

 * Basket 
 > Change the basket to booking as there is no check out

 > When in the basket no pricing should be seen 

 > Take the basket total out.

 > User should not be able to select quantity

 > Change order now to book now. When clicked all details of the animal should be displayed

 * Admin
 > View all orders to change to view current bookings, should display animal name instead of total price

 * Misc
 > Add date for when the animal was rescued.

 > Add link to the PETHAVEN in the navbar to navigate back home.

 > Change "Products" to "Animals" where need be, also in the database.

 > 

 * Additional changes when we come across them can be added below
